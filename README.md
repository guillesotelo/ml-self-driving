# Self-Driving Car with Machine Learning (JavaScript)

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a self-driving car simulation powered by machine learning and implemented in JavaScript. The project focuses on training an AI model to control a car and navigate it safely through an environment with other cars, avoiding collisions.

## Features

- Real-time simulation of a self-driving car.
- Machine learning model using JavaScript for decision-making.
- Collision avoidance with other cars.
- Training and testing modes to improve the AI's performance.
- Interactive visualization of the car's behavior and neural network triggers.

## Get Started

### Play and Train

Simply open the index.html file in your browser and save the best results before the car hits anything. 
Every time you save the training, it will be available for the next round, making the model more and more intelligent for the decition making.

Happy self-driving!
